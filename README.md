I've heard that some Rose students are using this project to cheat. I will advise you that this is doing a disservice to yourself in two ways. First, and most importantly, cheating on any assignment robs you of the learning you would do by completing the assignment yourself. Second, even if you do feel like throwing away your tuition dollars, this wasn't a particularly good implementation of this project.

Run the program by typing in a list of class names in the run configuration separated by spaces.
Optional arguments for the visibility of methods/classes/fields: use --public, --private, or --protected. 
To see diagram with recursive inheritance, use -r.
We peer programmed everything described in the milestone.
